abstract: Generally, various models can be used to describe a given application domain on different aspects and thus give rise to several views. To have a complete view of the application domain, heterogeneous models need to be unified, which is a hard task to do. To tackle this problem, we have proposed a method to relate partial models without combining them in a single model. In our approach, partial models are organized as a network of models through a virtual global model called M1C (Model of correspondences between models) which conforms to a ubiquitous language based on a Meta-Model of Correspondences (MMC). This paper presents an application of our method to an “Emergency Department” case study. It has been performed as a collaborative process involving model designers and a supervisor. The focus is put on the building of the M1C model from 3 partial models.

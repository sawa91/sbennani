abstract: To design a complex system, we often proceed via separation of viewpoints. Each viewpoint is described by a model that represents a domain expertise. Those partial models are generally heterogeneous (i.e conform to different metamodels) and thus performed by different designers. We proposed a matching process that links partial models through a virtual global model in order to create a complete view of the system. As models evolve, we should consider the impact of changing an element involved in a correspondence on other models to keep the coherence of the global view. So, we have defined a process that automatically identify changes, classify them and treat their potential repercussions on elements of other partial models in order to maintain the global model consistency.

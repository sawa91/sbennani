abstract: Complex systems are typically designed collaboratively by stakeholders from different domains. This multi viewpoints paradigm promotes the separation of concerns since separate teams, from different business viewpoints, build partial models describing the system. These partial models are naturally heterogeneous. So, it is difficult to ensure their intermodel consistency if kept separately. For that, we propose a collaborative approach that combines Group Decision Making (GDM) and Model-Based Engineering (MBE). This paper highlights the GDM part of our approach and especially the concept of decision policy that enables coming up with collective decisions in group decision-making contexts.

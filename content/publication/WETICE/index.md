abstract: Design of complex systems goes through a multiview paradigm in which separate teams, from different business viewpoints, build partial models describing the system. As they are expressed in different languages, these partial models are called heterogeneous models. To maintain the global systemâ€™s consistency, we propose a collaborative approach that combines Group Decision Making (GDM) and Model-Based Engineering. This paper presents a metamodel for collaborative decision elaboration via a set of decision policies which are instances of GDM patterns. Our approach is illustrated with a hospital Emergency Department case study and is supported by a tool allowing models alignment through GDM based processes.

abstract: Design of complex systems implies various points of view expressed by stakeholders with different areas of expertise. Each stakeholder describes his model in a Domain Specific Language, according to his point of view. Ensuring the consistency of the global system and building a cross view is a challenging task. It requires the involvement of all stakeholders to produce intermodel correspondences that satisfy their concerns. In this paper, we first introduce a metamodel of collaboration that formalizes collaborative work, then we use this metamodel to define a collaborative process for heterogeneous design models matching. This approach establishes semantic links at metamodel level by following a group decision-making process, then it refines those links semi-automatically at model level by exploiting their semantics.

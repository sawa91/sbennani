title: Towards a collaborative matching approach to relate sustainable cities design models

event: EuroScience Open Forum 2018
event_url: https://toulouse2018.esof.eu/en/

location: Toulouse, France

abstract: "Sustainable cities are typical examples of complex systems, they involve several subsystems
(e.g. social, ecological, technical ones, etc.). These subsystems are naturally heterogeneous
due to the various disciplines they come from. Each one of them focuses on a given concern
and the complexity of the whole is therefore reduced thanks to the paradigm of separation of
concerns.
Managing efficiently the design of a sustainable city requires developing a collaborative
knowledge by interconnecting these subsystems since they may use or affect the same
resources."
